# Evermos Case Study

This repository is created for my interview into Evermos. The prompt is as follows.

> Case:
> 1. create catalog page which contains list of products
> 2. create product detail page which contains information such as product images, price, product variance, etc. You may make it as eye catching as possible

> Requirements:
> 1. maximize the use of SSR (Serverside Rendering) and CSR (Client side rendering) concept and you may use js framework such as nuxt js or next js
> 2. using proper state management is a must
> 3. proper implementation of CSS pre processor
> 4. proper use of framework lifecycle
> 5. clean code & well-naming variable is a must
> 6. responsive layout
> 7. use mockup api of your choice, example: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)
> 8. use git repository such as github, gitlab, bitbucket
> 9. deploy your web apps so it can be accessed via internet

> Nice to have:
> 1. great consideration for UI and UX implementation is highly recommended, i.e implementing navigation, slider, gallery etc
> 2. make UI style from scratch without using library such as tailwind, bootstrap
> 3. use of animation
